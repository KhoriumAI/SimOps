# Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains records of major technical decisions, mathematical models, and architectural choices made in the project.

## How to use
1. **Browse Existing Records**: Before implementing a major change, check existing ADRs to understand the context and rationale behind current systems.
2. **Propose New Decisions**: Use the template provided in the main `README.md` to draft new ADRs.
3. **Review and Update**: ADRs should be updated as decisions evolve or are deprecated.

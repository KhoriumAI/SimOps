# Khorium Skills Toolbox

This folder serves as a repository for generalized solutions and "skills" developed during the SimOps project. 

## Purpose
When a piece of code solves a generalized problem (beyond a single specific task), it should be documented here as part of a toolbox for future use.

## Usage
- **Add Skills:** When you write a tool or utility that can be reused, add it here with a clear comment at the top explaining its function.
- **Reference Skills:** Check this folder if you're stuck on a problem; it may contain a pre-existing solution or building block.

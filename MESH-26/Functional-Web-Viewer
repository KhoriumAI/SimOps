Desired Features:

Web renderer (VTK), be able to visualize step files and meshes with quality coloring

User login & Credentialing system

Pass information from frontend to backend server (localhost, Nebius, Coreweave)

Functionality check (Mesh with Tet Delaunay), Determine Quality, Take a Cross Section, Export Mesh & View in Gmsh without issue

(Optional) Ability to select a face on CAD or Mesh & assign a name to it

(Optional) Histogram distribution for Quality — A small chart overlay showing the distribution of element quality. A "Bell Curve" shifted right is good; a "Long Tail" to the left is bad.

(Optional) Real time timer of how long this particular mesh has been running for

Considerations:

Is VTK our best choice for renderer?

How can we pass large amounts of information from frontend to backend without it lagging out the system? (High FPS) (Mauybe use binary formats like .vtu (XML Binary) or .glb (glTF). VTK.js handles .vtu files natively and efficiently.)

What bottlenecks can we cache?

How do we manage memory on the browser-side?

If you need us to setup any resources (Nebius, Coreweave, AWS…etc) don't hesitate to reach out
